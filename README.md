# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The data provided for this analysis included csv files containing information about schools and students.  In total, there were 15 schools and the csv file identified the type of school, number of students, and budget.  The type of school provided information about if the school was a district or charter school. The student csv file included information about the students such as name, grade, school, as well as each student's reading and math scores.  

For this analysis, it is worth noting that there are differences between district schools and charter schools.  These differences lead to different standards for academics, programs, as well as admissions.  The funding for the school also does not come from the same source.  I believe that it is important to recognize these differences and understand that comparing district schools to charter schools is not entirely apples to apples.
